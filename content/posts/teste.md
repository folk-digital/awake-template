Netlify Identity Widget

A component used to authenticate with Netlify's Identity service. Live demo



For usage example with React and React Router, please see our /example folder and read the README.



What is Netlify Identity

Netlifyâ€™s Identity service is a plug-and-play microservice for handling site functionalities like signups, logins, password recovery, user metadata, and roles. You can use it from single page apps instead of rolling your own, and integrate with any service that understands JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).



Learn more about this service from this blog post.
